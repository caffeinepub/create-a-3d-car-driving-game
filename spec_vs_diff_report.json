  "summary": "The diff implements a comprehensive reel/short-video app replacement of the 3D car game frontend. All five requirements (REQ-10 through REQ-14) appear to be addressed except REQ-14. The car game files are cleared, a vertical snap-scroll feed with full-screen reel cards is implemented, action icons with like/comment/share are on the right side, a top nav with logo and tabs is present, 6 mock reels are seeded as static data with Pexels video URLs, and the dark orange-red accent theme is applied. However, the diff does not show the backend/main.mo file being modified, which is required by REQ-14.",
